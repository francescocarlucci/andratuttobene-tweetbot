# "#andratuttobene" TweetBot

This is a "quarantine project" I wrote for fun :)

The bot is supposed to leave a nice comment on a random tweet about queried from the #coronavirus topic feed.

#### Please create credentials.txt, log.txt, stopwords.txt, lastpost_date.txt as empty files in your project root to make it work!

### TODO

- automate txt storage files creation
